"""
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times.
You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]

# Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm
#
# Intuition
# If we had some way of counting instances of the majority element as +1
# and instances of any other element as -1,
# summing them would make it obvious that the majority element is indeed
# the majority element.
#
# Algorithm
# Essentially, what Boyer-Moore does is look for a suffix suf
# of nums where suf[0] is the majority element in that suffix.
# To do this, we maintain a count,
# which is incremented whenever we see an instance of our current candidate
# for majority element and decremented whenever we see anything else.
# Whenever count equals 0,
# we effectively forget about everything in nums up to the current index
# and consider the current number as the candidate for majority element.
